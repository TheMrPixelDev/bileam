# Bileam

Bileam is my attempt to solve state management in Vanilla JavaScript Applications. You can use DataStores as a single source of truth for global application data to which you can subscribe to.
There are also helper functions which abstract the task of binding certain dom events to that data, in order to achive bidirectional data binding.
